Welcome to the Project VERA tutorial for EPICS / EtherCAT!
===================================

**Project VERA** is a diploma project by students from the HTL Rennweg in Vienna, with the main focus being 
the modernization of the *Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator* (VERA) at the University of Vienna. 
One large aspect of this project is the introduction of a new process control system based on **EPICS**\ , which is meant 
to control the electronics mainly through **EtherCAT** modules made by Beckhoff.

In the process of implementing EPICS and learning everything we could about it, we found that 
finding a place to begin was very difficult, and it took a long time until we got some basic things to work. 
As a result, we have decided to make our knowledge in form of our documentation and some tutorials public. 
We have also tried to make this as understandable and easy to use as possible.
