Welcome to the Project VERA tutorial for EPICS / EtherCAT!
===================================

**Project VERA** is a diploma project by students from the HTL Rennweg in Vienna, with the main focus being 
the modernization of the *Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator* (VERA) at the University of Vienna. 
One large aspect of this project is the introduction of a new process control system based on **EPICS**\ , which is meant 
to control the electronics mainly through **EtherCAT** modules made by Beckhoff. 
You can check us out on our `instagram <https://www.instagram.com/project_vera.official/>`_ or on our `website <https://project-vera.webflow.io/>`_

In the process of implementing EPICS and learning everything we could about it, we found that 
finding a place to begin was very difficult, and it took a long time until we got some basic things to work.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
