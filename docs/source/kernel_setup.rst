Kernel Setup
===================================

To get the same kernel setup as in our project, you can follow these steps on your own Debian 12 computer.

The installation of this will take some time, so take into account that your machine might have to stay turned on for multiple hours while it is compiling.

.. note::
    This actually might not be necessary, but we had to do it on our computers. Once we find a way of doing all the steps without this kernel, we will add it to the documentation.


.. code-block:: bash

   $ echo "Hello, World!"


well hello this is a test
